Despite Lumbini’s global recognition as the birthplace of the Buddha and its UNESCO World Heritage status, the region has yet to realize its full tourism potential. Most visitors currently spend only a few hours at key sites due to limited tourism offerings, weak promotion and branding, and inadequate tourism infrastructure and facilities—resulting in “hit-and-run” tourism with low economic impact.Anchored in Lumbini’s spiritual and cultural significance, the project will shift from fragmented, site-specific interventions to a holistic, integrated destination model that improves services, strengthens connectivity, diversifies tourism products, and actively engages communities and the private sector. It will target three main visitor segments: (i) pilgrimage and heritage tourists, by enhancing the visitor experience and developing sites across the GLBC; (ii) cultural travelers visiting the region for whom Lumbini is currently a secondary stop, by improving connectivity, marketing, and product offerings; and (iii) new markets, especially in East and Southeast Asia, through stronger branding and targeted promotion.The proposed project will focus on four priority sites: the Lumbini Master Plan Area—home to the Maya Devi Temple—and three culturally and ecologically significant locations: Tilaurakot (ancient Kapilvastu), Devdaha (maternal home of Queen Maya Devi), and Ramgram (the only intact relic stupa containing the Buddha’s remains). Site selection is based on cultural and historical significance, tourism potential, and alignment with recommendations from UNESCO and ICOMOS for a unified management vision and heritage-sensitive development. Additional sites within the Greater Lumbini Area may be considered subject to their alignment with the project Development Objective—particularly in enhancing cultural heritage value, improving visitor experiences, and generating local economic opportunities and jobs.The proposed project will foster community-centered and environmentally responsible tourism, integrating benefit-sharing models to ensure local ownership, protect cultural and natural heritage, and address environmental and social challenges. It will also actively engage the private sector alongside the public sector to create opportunities to unlock investment and innovation. Finally, the proposed project will embody the One WBG approach in its preparation and implementation, leveraging the recent institutional changes that strengthen cross-Group collaboration.

{"slug": "wb-P507433", "type": "project", "sub_type": "development_project", "names": [{"kind": "PRIMARY", "en": {"full": "Modernization of Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project - Phase 3"}}], "description": {"en": {"value": "Agriculture is central to Nepal's economy and integral to poverty reduction.  It accounted for over 60 percent of employment and nearly 24 percent of GDP in 2022.  But the productivity and level of income from agriculture remain below potential because of underinvestment in critical enablers, such as irrigation services, agriculture value chains, and watershed services.  Therefore, this project contributes to addressing constraints to agricultural productivity while also building the resilience of the sector to climate extremes.  Nepal is rich in water resources but only uses about 10 percent of it for productive purposes due to inadequate infrastructure.  Nepal has a total of 2.53 million ha of irrigable arable land, of which 62 percent is irrigated, and less than 40 percent has access to year-round irrigation, leaving the agricultural sector unproductive and highly exposed to rainfall variability.   The result is persistent food insecurity (affecting over 12 percent of the population) and rising food imports (150 percent increase since 2014).  The project is the last of three phases of a long-term government program that has been under implementation since 2012 to modernize the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation scheme – the largest irrigation scheme in the western region of Nepal.  The Bank supported both Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project (RJKIP) Phase 1 (2012-2017) and Phase 2 (2018-2025), which modernized irrigation infrastructure on 14,300 hectares, enhanced flood and erosion control, improved rural roads and bridges for better connectivity and market access, and promoted watershed conservation, capacity building of water user associations, and agricultural support services. These efforts have benefited over 157,000 people. RJKIP 3 will build on these achievements, expand access to irrigation services, increase farm productivity, enhance climate resilience, and boost rural incomes in Kailali district, Sudurpaschim Province. It will construct the distribution network westward, along with complementary investments in agriculture and watershed management. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve irrigation services and agricultural productivity in the target areas. It addresses three of the World Bank’s priority global challenges: i) Water security and access; ii) Climate change adaptation and mitigation; and (iii) Food and Nutrition Security. The project consists of four key components aimed at enhancing irrigation service, watershed management, and agricultural support services in the region. Component 1: Irrigation Improvement and Development (US$95 million) seeks to expand and improve the irrigation network across approximately 17,500 ha of existing agricultural land in Pathariya, where farmers do not have access to year-round irrigation, and the availability of water is expected to be further exacerbated by climate-induced changes in rainfall patterns and an increased likelihood of droughts. The component will distribute part of the existing intake discharge of 80 m³/s drawn at Chisapani from Karnali River. The main canal bifurcates to supply the allotted 40 m³/s to the RJK area and the remaining 40 m³/s to Lamki and Pathariya (see Figure 2). From that point, the GoN has completed the construction of the Lamki feeder canal and is in the process of developing distribution networks in its command area. However, the feeder canal and distribution networks in the Pathariya area (17,500 ha) have yet to be developed, which this project aims to complete. These investments will enable farmers in that region to access their designated canal water supply throughout the year and increase cropping intensity, thereby enhancing the resilience of beneficiaries to climate shocks and contributing to climate adaptation. Component 2: Watershed Management (US$20 million)  will finance activities to prevent soil erosion, conserve watershed areas, and mitigate the impact of floods and droughts on agricultural productivity. It includes riverbank protection, landslide and gully control, check dams, and afforestation. The component will also support the rehabilitation and augmentation of existing small-sized multipurpose water storage to capture monsoon precipitation. This is crucial for sustainable water storage and the long-term sustainability of irrigation systems. Component 3: Agriculture Support Services (US$11 million) will serve the command areas covered by the RJK irrigation system, including the area from RJKIP Phases 1 & 2, and Pathariya.

It accounted for over 60 percent of employment and nearly 24 percent of GDP in 2022.  But the productivity and level of income from agriculture remain below potential because of underinvestment in critical enablers, such as irrigation services, agriculture value chains, and watershed services.  Therefore, this project contributes to addressing constraints to agricultural productivity while also building the resilience of the sector to climate extremes.  Nepal is rich in water resources but only uses about 10 percent of it for productive purposes due to inadequate infrastructure.  Nepal has a total of 2.53 million ha of irrigable arable land, of which 62 percent is irrigated, and less than 40 percent has access to year-round irrigation, leaving the agricultural sector unproductive and highly exposed to rainfall variability.   The result is persistent food insecurity (affecting over 12 percent of the population) and rising food imports (150 percent increase since 2014).  The project is the last of three phases of a long-term government program that has been under implementation since 2012 to modernize the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation scheme – the largest irrigation scheme in the western region of Nepal.  The Bank supported both Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project (RJKIP) Phase 1 (2012-2017) and Phase 2 (2018-2025), which modernized irrigation infrastructure on 14,300 hectares, enhanced flood and erosion control, improved rural roads and bridges for better connectivity and market access, and promoted watershed conservation, capacity building of water user associations, and agricultural support services. These efforts have benefited over 157,000 people. RJKIP 3 will build on these achievements, expand access to irrigation services, increase farm productivity, enhance climate resilience, and boost rural incomes in Kailali district, Sudurpaschim Province. It will construct the distribution network westward, along with complementary investments in agriculture and watershed management. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve irrigation services and agricultural productivity in the target areas. It addresses three of the World Bank’s priority global challenges: i) Water security and access; ii) Climate change adaptation and mitigation; and (iii) Food and Nutrition Security. The project consists of four key components aimed at enhancing irrigation service, watershed management, and agricultural support services in the region. Component 1: Irrigation Improvement and Development (US$95 million) seeks to expand and improve the irrigation network across approximately 17,500 ha of existing agricultural land in Pathariya, where farmers do not have access to year-round irrigation, and the availability of water is expected to be further exacerbated by climate-induced changes in rainfall patterns and an increased likelihood of droughts. The component will distribute part of the existing intake discharge of 80 m³/s drawn at Chisapani from Karnali River. The main canal bifurcates to supply the allotted 40 m³/s to the RJK area and the remaining 40 m³/s to Lamki and Pathariya (see Figure 2). From that point, the GoN has completed the construction of the Lamki feeder canal and is in the process of developing distribution networks in its command area. However, the feeder canal and distribution networks in the Pathariya area (17,500 ha) have yet to be developed, which this project aims to complete. These investments will enable farmers in that region to access their designated canal water supply throughout the year and increase cropping intensity, thereby enhancing the resilience of beneficiaries to climate shocks and contributing to climate adaptation. Component 2: Watershed Management (US$20 million)  will finance activities to prevent soil erosion, conserve watershed areas, and mitigate the impact of floods and droughts on agricultural productivity. It includes riverbank protection, landslide and gully control, check dams, and afforestation. The component will also support the rehabilitation and augmentation of existing small-sized multipurpose water storage to capture monsoon precipitation. This is crucial for sustainable water storage and the long-term sustainability of irrigation systems. Component 3: Agriculture Support Services (US$11 million) will serve the command areas covered by the RJK irrigation system, including the area from RJKIP Phases 1 & 2, and Pathariya. The objective of this component is to enhance the productivity, capacity, and resilience of the farmers to floods and droughts through value addition, post-production support, market access, and adoption of modern technologies on a demand-driven basis. The activities will include (i) strengthening and mobilization of local cooperatives, adoption of modern technology, promoting mechanization, promotion of climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, nursery establishment, commercial farming targeting high-value crops; (ii) providing of grants, and (iii) providing postproduction support for storage, processing, and marketing of targeted agricultural produce; (iv) providing training and capacity building.

This Component will finance the implementation of emergency infrastructure reconstruction, rehabilitation, and associated studies (Emergency Response Activities).", "borrower": "Nepal", "impagency": "Department of Water Supply and Sewerage Management,Ministry of Water Supply", "major_sectors": [{"major_sector": {"major_sector_code": "WX", "major_sector_name": "FY17 - Water, Sanitation and Waste Management", "sectors": [{"sector_name": "FY17 - Sanitation", "sector_code": "WA", "sector_percent": "33.0"}, {"sector_name": "FY17 - Water Supply", "sector_code": "WC", "sector_percent": "49.0"}, {"sector_name": "FY17 - Public Administration - Water, Sanitation and Waste Management", "sector_code": "WF", "sector_percent": "18.0"}]}}], "major_sector_name": "FY17 - Water, Sanitation and Waste Management", "major_sector_code": "WX", "countrycode": ["NP"], "status": "Active", "mjsector": "FY17 - Public Administration - Water, Sanitation and Waste Management,FY17 - Sanitation,FY17 - Water Supply", "regionhomepageurl": "http://www.worldbank.org/sar", "project_name": "Water Sector Governance and Infrastructure Support Project", "curr_project_cost": "100000000", "esrc_ovrl_risk_rate": "Substantial", "countryhomepageurl": "http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/nepal"}}], "project_url": "https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P176589", "_migration_metadata": {"wb_project_id": "P176589", "implementing_agencies": [{"name": "Department of Water Supply and Sewerage Management,Ministry of Water Supply"}], "executing_agencies": [], "development_agencies": [{"name": "World Bank", "architecture": "Multilateral", "group": "MDB"}]}}

The operation seeks to strengthen the enabling conditions for investments to meet electricity demand in a reliable and sustainable manner. It also seeks to achieve greater integration with the regional electricity market to ensure the optimal use of Nepal’s hydropower resource. IDA will provide US100 million dollars equivalent credit for the second operation in the DPC series. The operation supports the World Bank's twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity and is consistent with the World Bank Group's approach to Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD) and the Country Partnership Strategy for FY2019-2023. The DPC series complements the World Bank Group’s (WBG’s) existing engagement in generation, transmission, distribution and off-grid, renewable-based solutions in the form of investment operations and technical assistance (TA). In addition, the operation has synergy with WBG’s engagement in social protection, environmental and social risk and impact management, and water resources management. The operation also leverages the work undertaken by other development partners to support electricity sector reforms in Nepal.", "borrower": "Nepal", "impagency": "Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation", "major_sectors": [{"major_sector": {"major_sector_code": "AX", "major_sector_name": "FY17 - Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry", "sectors": [{"sector_name": "FY17 - Forestry", "sector_code": "AT", "sector_percent": "6.0"}]}}, {"major_sector": {"major_sector_code": "LX", "major_sector_name": "FY17 - Energy and Extractives", "sectors": [{"sector_name": "FY17 - Renewable Energy Hydro", "sector_code": "LH", "sector_percent": "25.0"}, {"sector_name": "FY17 - Energy Transmission and Distribution", "sector_code": "LT", "sector_percent": "31.0"}, {"sector_name": "FY17 - Renewable Energy Solar", "sector_code": "LU", "sector_percent": "6.0"}, {"sector_name": "FY17 - Other Energy and Extractives", "sector_code": "LZ", "sector_percent": "32.0"}]}}], "major_sector_name": "FY17 - Agriculture, Fishing and Forestry,FY17 - Energy and Extractives", "major_sector_code": "AX,LX", "countrycode": ["NP"], "status": "Closed", "mjsector": "FY17 - Energy Transmission and Distribution,FY17 - Forestry,FY17 - Other Energy and Extractives,FY17 - Renewable Energy Hydro,FY17 - Renewable Energy Solar", "regionhomepageurl": "http://www.worldbank.org/sar", "project_name": "Second Programmatic Energy Sector Development Policy Credit", "curr_project_cost": "0", "countryhomepageurl": "http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/nepal"}}], "project_url": "https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P170248", "_migration_metadata": {"wb_project_id": "P170248", "implementing_agencies": [{"name": "Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation"}], "executing_agencies": [], "development_agencies": [{"name": "World Bank", "architecture": "Multilateral", "group": "MDB"}]}}

This project has four components. 1) The first component, Strengthening Critical Regulatory and Institutional Capacity, aims to focus on strengthening the ability of the Ministry of Livestock Development (MoLD) and its agencies at the regional, Municipality and village levels, to develop/modify and enforce a policy and regulatory framework that strengthens the livestock sector.

The SSDP aims to achieve these goals through improvements in equity, quality, efficiency, governance, and management of the school education sector. he proposed PforR operation is also consistent with the World Bank’s Education Strategy for Nepal that is focused on improving student learning outcomes and skills attainment using the following three pillars: (a) alignment of performance incentives at each level of service delivery—central, district, school, and classroom; (b) system strengthening for improved service delivery; and (c) consistent and cross-cutting focus on the labor market.The World Bank has been a longstanding partner in the education sector, including the school sector through a series of SWAp programs such as the EFA (2004–2009) and SSRP (2009–2016).The World Bank’s value added, in addition to the financing support, is on bringing global expertise and the learning from the best practices and lessons from interventions in countries across the world, thereby building linkages and maximizing synergies across crosscutting solution areas and better informing the World Bank’s operational and analytical work in the country.", "borrower": "Nepal Ministry of Education, Science and Technology", "impagency": "Ministry of Education, Science and Technology", "major_sectors": [{"major_sector": {"major_sector_code": "EX", "major_sector_name": "FY17 - Education", "sectors": [{"sector_name": "FY17 - Early Childhood Education", "sector_code": "EC", "sector_percent": "6.0"}, {"sector_name": "FY17 - Public Administration - Education", "sector_code": "EF", "sector_percent": "20.0"}, {"sector_name": "FY17 - Primary Education", "sector_code": "EP", "sector_percent": "37.0"}, {"sector_name": "FY17 - Secondary Education", "sector_code": "ES", "sector_percent": "37.0"}]}}], "major_sector_name": "FY17 - Education", "major_sector_code": "EX", "countrycode": ["NP"], "status": "Closed", "mjsector": "FY17 - Early Childhood Education,FY17 - Primary Education,FY17 - Public Administration - Education,FY17 - Secondary Education", "regionhomepageurl": "http://www.worldbank.org/sar", "project_name": "Nepal School Sector Development Program", "curr_project_cost": "6471850000", "esrc_ovrl_risk_rate": "Substantial", "countryhomepageurl": "http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/nepal"}}], "project_url": "https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P160748", "_migration_metadata": {"wb_project_id": "P160748", "implementing_agencies": [{"name": "Ministry of Education, Science and Technology"}], "executing_agencies": [], "development_agencies": [{"name": "World Bank", "architecture": "Multilateral", "group": "MDB"}]}}

There are four components to the project, the first component being institutional strengthening, and capacity building and implementation support of Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM). This component aims to develop and/or strengthen DHM's legal and regulatory frameworks, improve institutional performance as the main provider of weather, climate and hydrological information for the nation, build capacity of personnel and management, ensure operability of the future networks, and support project implementation.
