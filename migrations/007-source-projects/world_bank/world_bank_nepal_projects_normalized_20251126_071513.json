    "title": "Greater Lumbini Area Development Project",
    "description": "The proposed project will support the Government of Nepal in transforming the Greater Lumbini Buddhist Circuit (GLBC) into a sustainable, inclusive, and competitive cultural tourism destination that encourages longer stays, higher spending, and stronger economic benefits for local communities. Despite Lumbini’s global recognition as the birthplace of the Buddha and its UNESCO World Heritage status, the region has yet to realize its full tourism potential. Most visitors currently spend only a few hours at key sites due to limited tourism offerings, weak promotion and branding, and inadequate tourism infrastructure and facilities—resulting in “hit-and-run” tourism with low economic impact.Anchored in Lumbini’s spiritual and cultural significance, the project will shift from fragmented, site-specific interventions to a holistic, integrated destination model that improves services, strengthens connectivity, diversifies tourism products, and actively engages communities and the private sector. It will target three main visitor segments: (i) pilgrimage and heritage tourists, by enhancing the visitor experience and developing sites across the GLBC; (ii) cultural travelers visiting the region for whom Lumbini is currently a secondary stop, by improving connectivity, marketing, and product offerings; and (iii) new markets, especially in East and Southeast Asia, through stronger branding and targeted promotion.The proposed project will focus on four priority sites: the Lumbini Master Plan Area—home to the Maya Devi Temple—and three culturally and ecologically significant locations: Tilaurakot (ancient Kapilvastu), Devdaha (maternal home of Queen Maya Devi), and Ramgram (the only intact relic stupa containing the Buddha’s remains). Site selection is based on cultural and historical significance, tourism potential, and alignment with recommendations from UNESCO and ICOMOS for a unified management vision and heritage-sensitive development. Additional sites within the Greater Lumbini Area may be considered subject to their alignment with the project Development Objective—particularly in enhancing cultural heritage value, improving visitor experiences, and generating local economic opportunities and jobs.The proposed project will foster community-centered and environmentally responsible tourism, integrating benefit-sharing models to ensure local ownership, protect cultural and natural heritage, and address environmental and social challenges. It will also actively engage the private sector alongside the public sector to create opportunities to unlock investment and innovation. Finally, the proposed project will embody the One WBG approach in its preparation and implementation, leveraging the recent institutional changes that strengthen cross-Group collaboration. Teams from across the World Bank, IFC, and multiple sectors—including Finance, Competitiveness and Innovation (FCI), Transport, and Education—are working together to design an integrated operation that maximizes development impact.

These objectives will be achieved through the following project activities: Component 1: Adopting Cleaner Production Technologies to Reduce PM2.5 Emissions. The objective of this component is to support enterprises (industrial and commercial) to adopt cleaner technologies, including boilers and furnaces operating on cleaner fuels, such as electricity and pellets, and emission control devices. The project will focus predominately on micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the following categories of industries: food and beverage, textile, chemical, pharmaceutical, steel, hospitality, and hospitals. These industries have been identified as the main operators of boilers and furnaces using fossil fuels (coal, diesel, and oil), as well as inefficient boilers and furnaces using biomass. Component 2: Strengthening Air Quality Management through Enhanced Monitoring and Enforcement. This component will strengthen the GoN’s air quality management systems by reinforcing regulatory foundations, enhancing institutional capacity for enforcement, improving monitoring of existing pollution sources and strengthening domestic and regional collaboration. Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring, and Capacity Building. This component will support the establishment of the Project Steering Committee (PSC) chaired by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies and Project Implementation Units (PIUs) at Department of Industries and Department of Environment respectively. This component will support the costs associated with hiring key project staff and day-to-day functioning of the PIUs, office set up and equipment, and other incremental operating costs. In addition, this component will also finance service providers to support day-to-day implementation of the project activities, coordination, reporting and monitoring and evaluation requirements of the project.Component 4: Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC). The CERC is one of the Bank’s contingent financing mechanisms available to governments to gain rapid access to Bank financing to respond to a crisis or emergency. Following an eligible crisis or emergency, the Borrower may request the Bank to re-allocate project funds to support emergency response and reconstruction. This component would draw from the uncommitted credit resources under the project from other project components to cover emergency response. ",

To build trust and strengthen digital development and services in the country, the project will help bring government services directly to the people including marginalized and hard-to reach populations. This will enable individuals and businesses to transact via the Nagarik app, an integrated online- and mobile portal. To enable such seamless, online service delivery, the project will also invest in the necessary underlying Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) including national identity and national data exchange. The project will also support the government to develop appropriate data hosting infrastructure and data classification policy to ensure insulation from any natural or manmade disasters.  The design and implementation of digital platforms under this component will draw on good practice examples and lessons learned from countries like Moldova, Jordan, Singapore, South Korea, and Ukraine, with a robust track record of leveraging DPI for public service digitalization.The project will also support the GoN to create a legal and regulatory enabling environment to effectively develop their digital economy and create a trusted environment. This will include the drafting and amendment of a data protection law, cyber security law, electronic transactions law and national ID law. In addition, the project will support the GoN to develop data governance frameworks to effectively leverage data hosting and cloud computing. This will include data classification frameworks as well as data hosting guidance on use of hybrid or public cloud, outside of Nepal. Given Nepal’s fragilities it will be important to develop a cloud-first policy to enhance resilience and supporting business continuity. The project will also support digitalization of 11 services identified by the Government. This will include business process reengineering for the 11 services and full digitalization of select services including land administration.",

Therefore, this project contributes to addressing constraints to agricultural productivity while also building the resilience of the sector to climate extremes.  Nepal is rich in water resources but only uses about 10 percent of it for productive purposes due to inadequate infrastructure.  Nepal has a total of 2.53 million ha of irrigable arable land, of which 62 percent is irrigated, and less than 40 percent has access to year-round irrigation, leaving the agricultural sector unproductive and highly exposed to rainfall variability.   The result is persistent food insecurity (affecting over 12 percent of the population) and rising food imports (150 percent increase since 2014).  The project is the last of three phases of a long-term government program that has been under implementation since 2012 to modernize the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation scheme – the largest irrigation scheme in the western region of Nepal.  The Bank supported both Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project (RJKIP) Phase 1 (2012-2017) and Phase 2 (2018-2025), which modernized irrigation infrastructure on 14,300 hectares, enhanced flood and erosion control, improved rural roads and bridges for better connectivity and market access, and promoted watershed conservation, capacity building of water user associations, and agricultural support services. These efforts have benefited over 157,000 people. RJKIP 3 will build on these achievements, expand access to irrigation services, increase farm productivity, enhance climate resilience, and boost rural incomes in Kailali district, Sudurpaschim Province. It will construct the distribution network westward, along with complementary investments in agriculture and watershed management. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve irrigation services and agricultural productivity in the target areas. It addresses three of the World Bank’s priority global challenges: i) Water security and access; ii) Climate change adaptation and mitigation; and (iii) Food and Nutrition Security. The project consists of four key components aimed at enhancing irrigation service, watershed management, and agricultural support services in the region. Component 1: Irrigation Improvement and Development (US$95 million) seeks to expand and improve the irrigation network across approximately 17,500 ha of existing agricultural land in Pathariya, where farmers do not have access to year-round irrigation, and the availability of water is expected to be further exacerbated by climate-induced changes in rainfall patterns and an increased likelihood of droughts. The component will distribute part of the existing intake discharge of 80 m³/s drawn at Chisapani from Karnali River. The main canal bifurcates to supply the allotted 40 m³/s to the RJK area and the remaining 40 m³/s to Lamki and Pathariya (see Figure 2). From that point, the GoN has completed the construction of the Lamki feeder canal and is in the process of developing distribution networks in its command area. However, the feeder canal and distribution networks in the Pathariya area (17,500 ha) have yet to be developed, which this project aims to complete. These investments will enable farmers in that region to access their designated canal water supply throughout the year and increase cropping intensity, thereby enhancing the resilience of beneficiaries to climate shocks and contributing to climate adaptation. Component 2: Watershed Management (US$20 million)  will finance activities to prevent soil erosion, conserve watershed areas, and mitigate the impact of floods and droughts on agricultural productivity. It includes riverbank protection, landslide and gully control, check dams, and afforestation. The component will also support the rehabilitation and augmentation of existing small-sized multipurpose water storage to capture monsoon precipitation. This is crucial for sustainable water storage and the long-term sustainability of irrigation systems. Component 3: Agriculture Support Services (US$11 million) will serve the command areas covered by the RJK irrigation system, including the area from RJKIP Phases 1 & 2, and Pathariya. The objective of this component is to enhance the productivity, capacity, and resilience of the farmers to floods and droughts through value addition, post-production support, market access, and adoption of modern technologies on a demand-driven basis. The activities will include (i) strengthening and mobilization of local cooperatives, adoption of modern technology, promoting mechanization, promotion of climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, nursery establishment, commercial farming targeting high-value crops; (ii) providing of grants, and (iii) providing postproduction support for storage, processing, and marketing of targeted agricultural produce; (iv) providing training and capacity building. Component 4: Institutional Support and Project Management (US$11 million) will finance the capacity building and institutional strengthening of WUAs in the project area and DoWRI, and its implementation units.The expected outcomes include (a) 17,500 ha of farmland benefiting from year-round irrigation services, (b) 52,000 people benefiting from increased agricultural production, and (c) 160,000 people benefiting from enhanced climate resilience.  The beneficiaries of the project are the farming communities in Kailali District, Sudurpaschim province, who will benefit from access to irrigation and agricultural services, thereby increasing farm productivity, enhancing climate resilience, and boosting rural incomes.

    "title": "Third Bridges Improvement and Maintenance Program",
    "description": "Nepal’s Strategic Roads Network is a vital component of the country’s transportation infrastructure, connecting major cities, towns, and rural areas. However, the current state of the network faces numerous challenges, including aging infrastructure, vulnerability to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, and limited accessibility for certain populations. Historically, efforts to improve the road network have been hampered by a lack of resources, technical expertise, and organizational capacity. This project aims to address these issues by promoting resilient, safe, and inclusive connectivity and building the necessary technical and organizational capabilities within the Department of Roads.With respect to the PforR components:(i) Resilience in infrastructure refers to the ability of bridges to withstand and recover from natural disasters and other adverse events. In Nepal, this is particularly important due to the country’s susceptibility to earthquakes, landslides, and floods. Strategies to enhance resilience include using advanced construction materials and techniques, implementing robust maintenance practices, and incorporating disaster risk reduction measures into the design and planning stages. Examples of resilient infrastructure can be found in countries like Japan, where earthquake-resistant bridges and roads have been successfully implemented. (ii) Safety is a fundamental aspect of transportation infrastructure. Ensuring that bridges are safe for all users involves implementing stringent design and construction standards, regular inspections and maintenance, and incorporating safety features such as guardrails, signage, and lighting. In Nepal, improving road safety is particularly important due to the high incidence of traffic accidents and fatalities. By prioritizing safety in the design and construction of bridges, the project aims to reduce these risks and provide a safer travel experience for all users. (iii) Inclusivity in infrastructure projects means ensuring that all communities have access to safe and reliable connectivity. In Nepal, promoting inclusive connectivity is essential for fostering social and economic development, as it enables all citizens to participate fully in society, and  (iv) technical and organizational capabilities of the Department of Roads are critical to the successful implementation and maintenance of the project. Currently, the department faces several challenges, including a lack of technical expertise, outdated equipment, and limited access to advanced technologies. To address these issues, the project will focus on enhancing the department’s ability to design, construct, and maintain resilient, safe, and inclusive infrastructure. The project will support the department in enhancing its organizational capabilities through initiatives supporting the implementation of best practices in project management and administration.With respect to the IPF components:(i) conducting necessary technical audits and DLI verifications through a third party; (ii) procuring temporary, rapidly deployable bridges to restore critical connectivity in the event that permanent bridges are swept away or destroyed during monsoons, earthquakes, or other natural disasters; (iii) updating current bridge construction, maintenance, and inspection practices to account for increased stresses caused by severe climate incidents; (iv) enhancing the professional and institutional capacities of DoR staff, including their technical, social, environmental, and fiduciary skills; (v) supporting the Geo‐Environment and Social Unit (GESU) in its role as a gate reviewer for transport projects; and (vi) upgrading the current BMS to include a climate module that emphasizes resilience as a key criterion for prioritizing bridge inspection and maintenance.

The series of three operations is a key instrument for Nepal to operationalize its homegrown GRID Platform across the economy. This ambition is articulated in the 2021 Kathmandu Declaration on GRID, 2023 Joint Communiqué on GRID, Nepal’s 16th Five-Year Development Plan, and Nepal’s GRID Strategic Action Plan 2024-2034 (SAP) which is now being finalized after a series of provincial consultations. The GRID SAP includes over US10 billion dollars of ongoing and pipeline investments for ten key transitions. The World Bank and 15 other Development Partners (DPs) back this effort, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), International Finance Corporation (IFC), Asian Development Bank (ADB), the United Nations, and other multilateral, bilateral, and nongovernmental organizations that coordinate on policy, knowledge, and investment via Nepal’s GRID Platform. Nepal’s political situation remains fluid, yet commitment to GRID and this DPC series has been maintained by four successive coalition governments that have taken office since the November 2022 federal and provincial elections. The current coalition took over on July 14, 2024, led by the two largest parties in Parliament. This change has impacted the provincial government set up. At the sub-national level, funds, functions, and staff are managed by the seven provinces and 753 local governments for which legislation, institutions, and administrative procedures have been formalized as constitutionally prescribed. The federalization process is supported by this DPC series.",

This operation is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. First, the operation is fully aligned with the policy recommendations that have emerged from the Nepal’s Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) and is consistent with the climate priorities outlined in its Second Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), National Adaptation Plan (NAP), and Long-term Strategy (LTS). Second, on mitigation goals, the reforms under this operation do not significantly increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and do not introduce or reinforce persistent barriers to the country’s transition to low-GHG emissions. Third, on adaptation and resilience goals, risks from climate hazards are not likely to have an adverse effect on the prior actions’ contribution to the PDO. Prior Action 1 (PA1) aids the NAP and NDC goals to enhance disaster response, while PA2 focuses on updating building designs for climate resilience, in line with NDC and NAP. PA3 targets the NDC goal of expanding multi-hazard early warning systems. PA4 supports the NAP's capacity building initiatives for climate-informed policies and water infrastructure design. PA5 is in sync with the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) National Strategic Plan of Action, NAP, and NDC objectives to improve climate-sensitive disease surveillance by 2025. Therefore, all prior actions of the program are aligned with the adaptation and resilience goals of the Paris Agreement.",

The proposed AF will cover a financing gap under Component 2 linked to community-based sustainable forest management and smallholder forest plantations. Furthermore, the project paper proposes a restructuring to improve the project design and introduce new activities that are fundamental to achieving the adjusted project’s outcomes. The restructuring will also reallocate financing across components and, thus, scale up Component 3 on forest enterprise development and improvement.",

    "description": "The objective of the Third Nepal Finance for Growth Development Policy Credit Program is to support the Government of Nepal in its efforts to strengthen financial sector stability, diversify financial solutions, and increase access to financial services. The third Finance for Growth (F4G3) Development Policy Credit (DPC) will support the Government of Nepal (GoN) in its efforts to strengthen financial sector stability, diversify financial solutions, and increase access to financial services. The F4G3 DPC, in the amount of US80 million dollars equivalent, is the third in a programmatic series of three operations designed to support the country’s transition to the Green, Inclusive and Resilient Development (GRID) pathway, as announced in the Kathmandu Declaration of September 2021. The closing date is April 25, 2025. The proposed F4G3 DPC supports the approach taken by the GoN to return the economy on a post-pandemic recovery path in line with the GRID framework adopted in 2021. Pillar I of the proposed operation promotes resilience by supporting the institutional capacity of the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) to oversee the banking sector and by increasing public accountability of the banking sector for climate-related risks. Pillar II opens capital, insurance, and disaster risk markets and fosters financial product innovations. Pillar III extends financial inclusion and improves ease of business-to business and household-to-business transactions. The gender gap in access to digital financial services is addressed via a combination of reforms, specifically targeting women and women entrepreneurs. Climate agenda is fostered through enhancement of supervision of climate-related risk by financial sector regulators and by creating enabling environment for issuance of green financial products in line with the recommendations of the Nepal Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) (2022).",

The Project also aims to build capacity for service delivery at the local level, empowering municipalities to deliver on their water supply mandate. Given the lack of institutional capacity, the Project aims to help the participating local governments develop WASH institutions. The goal is to shift the current weak practices of the municipalities in planning, financing, and implementation of water infrastructure by equipping them to respond to their rapidly increasing infrastructure and service delivery requirements in a context of climate change. Component 1: Improving Sector Governance and Institutional Capacity, Project Management. This component focuses on improving water sector governance and building institutional capacity of water supply and sanitation related agencies at the three levels of governance in Nepal, i.e., Federal, Provincial and Local Municipality Level, including establishing dedicated municipality WASH units and municipal utilities.Component 2: Water Supply and Sanitation Infrastructure. This component is comprised of three subcomponents:(a) Urban and peri-urban water supply which includes: i. the construction and rehabilitation of water supply schemes in two urban municipalities (i.e., Birendranagar and Dipayal Salghadi in Karnali and Sudurpashchim provinces respectively), and ii. the construction of public toilets.(b) Rural water supply and sanitation, involving construction and rehabilitation of water supply schemes and the construction of public toilets in four rural municipalities (i.e., Sharada, Janaki, Joshipur and Bardogoriya) of Karnali and Sudurpashchim Provinces to provide safely managed water supply services.(c) Water Quality and Monitoring Management, involving the operationalization of a national water quality surveillance and governance system and integrated management information system (MIS).Works under this component will be phased and aligned with the institutional reforms implemented under Component 1 to ensure that the responsible implementing units would acquire the capacity to undertake the infrastructure works and to manage respective WSS services sustainably.Component 3: Contingency Emergency Response (US$0 million): A provisional zero amount Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC) is included, which will allow for rapid reallocation of credit proceeds from other project components in the event of an eligible disaster, including climate-related events and pandemics. This Component will finance the implementation of emergency infrastructure reconstruction, rehabilitation, and associated studies (Emergency Response Activities).",

    "description": "The development objectives of the Second Finance for Growth Development Policy Financing in Nepal support the Government of Nepal in its efforts to strengthen financial sector stability, diversify financial solutions, and increase access to financial services. Pillar 1, strengthening financial sector stability, helps to strengthen the Nepal Rastra Bank supervision effectiveness, addressing weaknesses in banking sector risks. Reforms to supervision methodologies, practices, and systems - combined with associated institutional capacity building - enable Nepal to comply with three Basel Core Principles related to bank supervision. Pillar 2, diversifying financial solutions, puts in place the enabling conditions through which financial markets can develop and provide new, diversified sources of sustainable, climate-resilient finance for inclusive and resilient growth. This allows the economy to diversify away from an overwhelming reliance on commercial bank lending. Results deriving from these reforms, including increased institutional investments in securities, growth of venture and private equity, and placement of new private sector-financed disaster products represent a significant change away from the traditional sources of bank and government financing. Pillar 3, increasing access to financial services, are designed to open access to a wider range of more competitively priced financial services - from within Nepal and internationally - and address the FSDS financial inclusion and climate objectives. This is achieved through a combination of policy reforms that change the market behavior of providers (fostering increases in international borrowing, new digital services, and guarantee products) and improve consumer bargaining power (through changes to collateral usage, borrower credit ratings and literacy training). In turn, this will ensure deepening of the financial sector through an increased demand for financial services.",

Specifically, the Project will support (a) trade facilitation, through augmenting infrastructure for transit management at key border crossing points, improvement of sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) management, and knowledge and capacity building support for improving management of trade; (b) regional connectivity improvement, through capacity augmentation in two roads within two critical corridors for trade and a safe corridor demonstration program; and (c) institutional strengthening of the National Road Safety Council and the Department of Roads, through inter alia developing and mainstreaming and road asset management, training and periodic maintenance of high traffic highways within the Strategic Road Network. Through these activities, the Project will also pilot or demonstrate ways to address four critical challenges plaguing the road sector, viz., sustainability, efficiency, climate impacts and road safety.  The proposed interventions together are envisaged to enhance transport and trade connectivity of land-locked Nepal with and via its neighbours in the region, and in particular, improve the efficiency of goods transit between Nepal and India through reducing time and costs and also make it more safe and resilient. This Project contributes to increasing trade within the eastern sub-region of South Asia, where the gap between reality and potential has been acute, and is in line with the commitment of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal (BBIN countries) in this sub-region to align and focus their interventions in selected priority areas including transport and trade facilitation.",

    "description": "The operation is the second in a series of three Development Policy Credit operations. The Energy Sector Development Policy Credit (DPC) operations aim to support the Government of Nepal’s (GoN) efforts to improve the financial viability and governance of the electricity sector. The programmatic DPC series has two pillars: (i) improving the financial viability of the electricity sector; and (ii) improving the governance of the electricity sector. The electricity sector is one of the key drivers of Nepal’s economy and has the potential to yield large economic dividend for the country by meeting domestic demand and generating revenues through electricity trade with neighbors. A twofold to fourfold increase in investment is needed to realize the full economic potential of the electricity sector. The operation seeks to strengthen the enabling conditions for investments to meet electricity demand in a reliable and sustainable manner. It also seeks to achieve greater integration with the regional electricity market to ensure the optimal use of Nepal’s hydropower resource. IDA will provide US100 million dollars equivalent credit for the second operation in the DPC series. The operation supports the World Bank's twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity and is consistent with the World Bank Group's approach to Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD) and the Country Partnership Strategy for FY2019-2023. The DPC series complements the World Bank Group’s (WBG’s) existing engagement in generation, transmission, distribution and off-grid, renewable-based solutions in the form of investment operations and technical assistance (TA). In addition, the operation has synergy with WBG’s engagement in social protection, environmental and social risk and impact management, and water resources management. The operation also leverages the work undertaken by other development partners to support electricity sector reforms in Nepal.",

    "description": "This second operation in the programmatic DPC series (DPC2) is supported through other World Bank and donor engagements. DPC2 supports reforms under two pillars. Pillar one supports measures to establish a framework to move towards fiscal federalism through various legislations, policies and regulations while Pillar two supports reforms to improve the policy framework for public financial management at the provincial and local levels. The DPC series is complemented by other WBG instruments and activities of other donors supporting various aspects of the federalism transition. The Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Project (IPFMR), effective since October 2018, supports implementation of key reforms linked to strengthening budget execution and systems for reporting under the new federal structure. The Government has also embarked on reforms to strengthen legislation and the related framework for public investment management and Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), and define the role of provincial and local governments. This is being supported through the upcoming Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD) DPC. The reforms supported by this fiscal and PFM DPC series also complement the overall support to federalism being provided by Development Partners (DPs) through the multi-donor trust fund (MDTF). World Bank-UNDP supported Federalism Capacity Needs Assessment including assessments of all three tiers of government, as well as a mapping of DP’s support is being undertaken to assess capacity gaps for the transition to federalism at the request of the Government and its development partners. There is also a ‘federalism DPs working group’ comprising several DPs that meets regularly to harmonize assistance to the government on federalism transition. Overall, substantial risks to the operation stem largely from the level of capacity, as well as the political and stakeholder context. Jurisdictional overlap between the three tiers of government, lack of clarity and coherence between policies and devolved powers could undermine coordination across government agencies, impede reform implementation and disrupt service delivery. Resistance from some stakeholders that benefit from the current policies and status quo could further slowdown reforms. Weak institutional capacity and enforcement of rules and regulations, particularly at the provincial and local government levels, form significant sources of fiduciary risks and fragility. These risks are mitigated by strong government commitment to needed reforms, including those supported by this operation and extensive donor engagement to build institutional capacity.",

This program document describes the Fourth Financial Sector Stability Development Policy Credit (DPC4) to the GoN, in the amount of SDR 71.1 million (US$100 million equivalent). The initial IDA Financial Sector Stability Credit approved in June 2013, was a stand-alone single tranche credit in the amount of USD 30 million equivalent). The second and third credits (each in the amount of USD 100 million equivalent, and approved in June 2015 and March 2017, respectively), were designed in a programmatic series of three operations. The series has four pillars: (a) enhancing financial sector development; (b) restructuring and consolidating the financial system; (c) strengthening the legal and regulatory framework; and (d) enhancing the governance and transparency of the banking system.The proposed operation is consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2014–2017 that acknowledges the persistent financial sector weakness and the risk it poses to macroeconomic stability and economic growth. The Performance and Learning Review (PLR, FY2017) of the CPS also acknowledges the progress made through the series of DPCs, particularly in addressing the capital adequacy of state-owned banks, strengthening inspection and compliance, ensuring overall financial sector stability and contributing to access to finance. The Systematic Country Diagnostic (FY2018) highlights financial sector stability and inclusion as important aspects for broader economic growth and poverty reduction. The operation was prepared in close collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID).",

    "description": "The proposed operation will support the Government of Nepal (GoN) in its efforts to establish a framework to move towards fiscal federalism and improve public financial management.Nepal is at a historic juncture where it is establishing a federal democratic republic based on the 2015 Constitution.This Development Policy Credit (DPC) series is a key component of the World Bank’s support to federalism.With a focus on the fiscal and PFM aspects, this DPC series lays down the foundation for the new federal state, and will help mitigate the country’s elevated risk of fragility and conflict.The current three-year 14th Periodic Plan and the Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2030) aim to achieve graduation from least developed country status by 2022 and transition to middle-income status by 2030. The periodic plan guides the annual budget, while the 2030 Strategy is a guide to achieving longer-term goals. Some of the key areas that these strategies prioritize include job creation, urban development, investment in connectivity and infrastructure, improvements in human capital, strengthening of public service delivery, and improved PFM. The proposed operation supports the government’s efforts in some of these areas, including strengthened public service delivery (through the move to a federal structure) and improvements in PFM.The proposed operation supports the government’s transition from a centralized to a federal structure and reforms that enhance PFM. The operation is fully consistent with the government’s three year periodic plan and the 2030 Strategy. It is the first in a programmatic series of two operations and is organized under two pillars: (i) establish a framework to move towards federalism, and (ii) improve the policy framework for PFM.First pillar is to implement fiscal federalism the Parliament has approved the Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement Act which provides the legal framework for resource allocation among the three tiers of government. Second pillar is to improve the policy framework for public financial management is to strengthen public financial management systems, the MoF has: (i) integrated all public financial management systems onto one platform - Public Financial Management Information System and (ii) provided access to the PFMIS to all federal ministries.Nepal was the first country in the South Asia region to implement Medium-term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs), which was then discontinued.addition, while the federal government’s annual budget is anchored in the national development plan, the same is not true for the local governments due to the absence of local plans.Finally, in addition to the above reforms to support better budget preparation, an overarching legislation to govern fiscal policy will be necessary to ensure fiscal prudence.",

It has the following three subcomponents: (i) Policies and Regulatory Framework; (ii) Institutional Strengthening; and (iii) Establishing Livestock Management Information System. 2) The second component, Promoting Sector Innovation and Modernizing Service Delivery, aims to enhance the capacity of key stakeholders along the selected livestock supply chains to develop, disseminate and adopt best practices.  It has the following three subcomponents: (i) Support to Producers’ Organizations; (ii) Modernizing Service and Input Provision Systems; and (iii) Strengthening Farmers’ Training and Extension Services. 3) The third component, Promoting Inclusive Value Chains for Selected Livestock Commodities, seeks to develop a more commercial-oriented approach for selected livestock subsectors and to contribute to import substitution (for dairy products and goat meat) and export promotion (for Chyangra cashmere) by improving the productivity and value addition within the targeted value chains.  It has the following two subcomponents: (i) Development of Productive Partnerships (PP); and (ii) Financing Livestock Value Chains. 4) The fourth component, Project Management and Knowledge Generation, aims to support project implementation activities, including operating costs of the Project Management Unit (PMU) mapped to the MoLD Secretary’s office and will be responsible for ensuring that project activities are implemented in line with the provisions in the official project documents.",

Nepal presents unique challenges and opportunities for development.Nepal continues to transition from a postconflict status and through a complex and challenging political landscape.The Government’s Development Strategy 2030 aspires to have Nepal achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).Other key achievements under the SSRP include the following: (a) initiation and completion of several rounds of National Assessment of Student Achievement (NASA); (b) initiation of Early Childhood Education and Development (ECED) as an important element of basic education and the early grade reading (EGR) program; and (c) continued implementation of the EMIS to regularly collect school-level data, which are being used for planning purposes, including for the allocation of PCF to schools and the bottom-up budgeting process of the Department of Education (DOE) whereby District Education Offices (DEOs) make budget proposals through their district-level annual work plans and budgets (AWPBs), which in turn are informed by school improvement plans (SIPs) submitted by schools.Despite the achievements, much remains to be done on learning outcomes, equitable access, and system strengthening. The most pressing challenge going forward is low and unequal quality of school education at basic and secondary education.urthermore, learning outcomes vary significantly by geography, school, and individual/household characteristics. The proposed PforR is well aligned with the World Bank Group’s Nepal Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2014–2018.The proposed Program will support the Government’s School Sector Development Program (SSDP), which has set the following goals: (a) to contribute to socioeconomic development and reduce disparities through inclusive development of its human resources and (b) to facilitate all citizens with opportunities to become functionally literate and numerate and to develop the basic life skills and knowledge required to enjoy a productive life taking into account the diversity of context and needs including the forthcoming federal structure of the country. The SSDP aims to achieve these goals through improvements in equity, quality, efficiency, governance, and management of the school education sector. he proposed PforR operation is also consistent with the World Bank’s Education Strategy for Nepal that is focused on improving student learning outcomes and skills attainment using the following three pillars: (a) alignment of performance incentives at each level of service delivery—central, district, school, and classroom; (b) system strengthening for improved service delivery; and (c) consistent and cross-cutting focus on the labor market.The World Bank has been a longstanding partner in the education sector, including the school sector through a series of SWAp programs such as the EFA (2004–2009) and SSRP (2009–2016).The World Bank’s value added, in addition to the financing support, is on bringing global expertise and the learning from the best practices and lessons from interventions in countries across the world, thereby building linkages and maximizing synergies across crosscutting solution areas and better informing the World Bank’s operational and analytical work in the country.",

    "description": "The development objective of Third Financial Sector Stability Development Policy Credit Project (DPC3) for Nepal is to support the medium-term reform program for the financial sector initiated by the Nepalese authorities to reduce the vulnerability of the banking sector and increase its transparency. The objective of the credit is to support the financial sector medium-term reform program initiated by the Nepalese authorities to reduce the vulnerability of the banking sector and increase its transparency. This program has four pillars: (a) enhancing financial sector development, (b) restructuring and consolidating the financial system, (c) strengthening the legal and regulatory framework, and (d) enhancing the governance and transparency of the banking system. The second phase of the government’s financial sector reform program (2014–2017), focuses on reforms designed to achieve two overarching policy objectives: first, to ensure the stability of the financial system by improving the quality of regulation, supervision, transparency, and governance to levels closer to international norms, and second, to start improving access to formal financial services. The programmatic series of DPCs complements the GoN’s program and is grounded in analytical work carried out by the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), and the 2014 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).",

The program to be supported by the PforR financing is a subset of the larger Nepal Health Sector Strategy (NHSS) program of the Government of Nepal (GoN) and focuses on specific NHSS outcomes in critical areas of public management reforms. The government’s reform program recognizes that improved health outcomes hinge on the ability of the Ministry of Health (MoH) to direct public resources to areas of need and to react to and make evidence-based decisions. While it is important to continue to invest in expanding service delivery and improving equity, better developed government systems for financial management, procurement, and evidence-based decision-making will enhance the sustainability of these investments. Therefore, the PforR will support five of the nine outcomes of the NHSS, focusing on three themes: public procurement, financial management, and evidence-based decision-making for greater accountability and transparency.",

    "description": "The development objective of the Strengthening Systems for Social Protection and Civil Registration Project for Nepal is to improve the coverage of social security allowances and civil registration, and the delivery of social security allowances. The project supports the DOCR’s Civil Registration and Social Security Strengthening Program consists of four components. The first component, improving coverage of civil registration (CR) and social security allowances (SSA) will support the expansion of coverage of CR and SSA by establishing a National Population Register of individuals and household/family folders. The register will be updated through regular CRs and targeted outreach and communications campaigns.The goal is to establish a CR system that will allow all individuals/residents easy access to CR, enable regular monitoring of registrations, generate timely vital statistics from a central database, and establish linkage with programs such as SSA. This component has two sub-components. (i) data collection to establish a population register; and (ii) communication and outreach campaign; The second component, modernizing social Security delivery systems suffers from ineffective control and accountability, low operational efficiency, and poor services. Specific sources of the weaknesses include the absence of a reliable, modern information technology (IT) system to record and manage beneficiary enrollments and payment transactions and the lack of sufficiently trained personnel to manage these processes at the local level. This component has two sub-components. (i) rolling out electronic payments; and (ii) improving accountability and citizen engagement in the social security delivery process; The third component, institutional strengthening is to achieve the project objectives of increased coverage of social security beneficiaries and CR and improved delivery of SSA, the institutional framework regulating these two functions as well as the organizational capacity of the implementing bodies need to be enhanced. This component is designed to support a range of crosscutting activities for sustainable institutionalization of the improvements supported under Components 1 and 2 by building the Government’s organizational and institutional capacities for managing CR and SSA functions at both the central and local levels. The activities supported under this component will be divided into the following subcomponents: (i) strengthening systems at the central level; (ii) strengthening systems at the local level; The fourth component,will support project implementation and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) by establishing and maintaining an effective Project Management Unit (PMU) and district-level project implementation units (DL-PIUs), building capacity of the project management staff, and financing specific project evaluation studies (for example, spot checks, base/mid/end-line surveys).",

The present operation is also intended to provide emergency support to the Government of Nepal (GoN) following the April 25 earthquake. Although this operation was designed prior to the April 2015 earthquake, the magnitude of the devastation that ensued, the associated financial needs of GoN, as well as the heightened vulnerabilities of the financial sector as a result of the disaster - only make the rationale for the reforms and further financial support even stronger. Therefore an additional objective is to provide the GoN with much needed short term financial support to expedite and scale up relief and recovery efforts while mitigating new emerging financial sector weaknesses and allowing it to play its role in the broader post-disaster recovery effort. The presented credit is composed of four policy areas: first pillar, enhancing financial sector development; second pillar, restructuring and consolidating the financial system; third pillar, strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for crisis management, banking supervision, and payment systems; and fourth pillar, enhancing the governance and transparency of the banking system.",

The second component is the civil works.  This component will support districts to implement physical works needed for: (i) upgrading or rehabilitating rural transport infrastructure; and (ii) maintaining rural transport infrastructure. There will be two funding windows within component B as follows: window one will support routine and periodic maintenance of roads and crossing structures using a simplified output-based disbursement approach that ties release of International Development Association (IDA) and donor funds to the completion of works.

The credit recognizes the important progress made so far by the Nepalese authorities to tackle financial sector vulnerability and supports the acceleration of a medium term reform strategy which commenced implementation in 2011. This program document describes a stand-alone, single tranche, financial sector stability credit of US dollar 30 million to support the Government's efforts to address financial sector vulnerabilities that remain critical to macroeconomic stability and economic growth. The actions supported under the Development Policy Credit (DPC) form part of a broader, medium term Government program aimed at reinforcing banking sector stability and paving the way for the development of a robust and more inclusive financial sector. The key components of this medium term program are also described in detail in the document. Sufficient overall progress towards the objectives of the medium term program would allow the Bank to provide additional support in the form of a second DPC within about 18 months.",

    "description": "The development objective of the Bridges Improvement and Maintenance Program Project for Nepal is to provide safe, reliable and cost effective bridges on Nepal's strategic roads network (SRN). Nepal is still emerging from a 10-year armed conflict that ended in 2006 and is currently passing through a momentous and prolonged political transition which is still in a fragile and incomplete state. This transition entails two interrelated processes: promulgation of a new constitution and the completion of the ongoing peace process. The Constitution is expected to lead to a major restructuring of Nepal into a federal state while the completion of the peace process is expected to resolve the integration/rehabilitation of former Maoist combatants. Nepal's peace process is progressing with the closure of Maoist cantonments and political parties attempting to resolve all contentious outstanding constitutional issues. These issues include state restructuring, forms of governance, electoral system, constitutional court, and citizenship questions to be enshrined in the new constitution. Nepal's economic growth has been adversely affected by the political uncertainty. Growth over the past decade has been below potential, relying largely on remittances and tourism. Nonetheless, Nepal has made good progress both in terms of poverty reduction and improvement of social indicators. The World Bank will support the SRN bridge-related activities, a subset of the overall program of capital investment by Department of Roads (DOR) in Nepal's road and bridge infrastructure. The SRN Bridge Program under the Department of Roads is a subset of the overall program of investment in Nepal's road and bridge infrastructure. The scope of the program under DOR encompasses three primary activities: (i) planning, technical design and quality management of bridges; (ii) major and minor maintenance of existing bridge assets; and (iii) investments in new bridge construction. Effectively planning and implementing capital investment is the most critical part of achieving the SRN Bridge Program's intended outcomes.",

There are two components to the project. The first component is rapid results for nutrition initiatives at the ward level. This component will support the entire Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiative (RRNI) process. It will start at a Ward Citizen Forum where, invited by the Local Governance and Community (LGCDP) social mobilizer, key nutrition challenges of the community will be discussed. Assisted by a coach at the ward level, the Ward Citizen Forum will select a nutrition relevant goal from a menu of goals. A RRNI team will be formed at the ward level that will set an appropriate and realistic target for meeting the goal and pledge to achieve the goal within a 100-day period by mobilizing the community and finding the best approach to achieving the target in their particular context. Results of the initiatives will be recorded and maintained by Nutrition and Food Security Steering Committee (NFSSCs) and lessons of successful and innovative projects will be disseminated to other communities to ensure maximum learning. The second component is project management, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation. This component will provide support for the implementation of first component under three sub-components: (i) capacity enhancement of the project management team, including cluster units, and NFSSCs, as well as of coaches and social mobilizers. This includes financing of a mid-line and end-line survey as well as financing annual conferences where findings and innovations of successful RRNI teams will be presented as well as whether the expected outcomes of the rapid results initiatives were achieved. Evaluation of the program is one of the primary aims during implementation.",

There are four components to the project. The first component of the project is strengthening Technical Education and Vocational Training (TEVT) regulatory activities and capacity building. This component focuses on the regulatory environment and institutional resources available to the TEVT sector and consistent with the new policy and fully aligned with the existing policy for TEVT (2007). Disbursement under this component will be results-based and linked to specific milestones for each activity supported. The second component of the project is strengthening technical education. This component focuses on strengthening technical education at the Technical School Leaving Certificate (TSLC) and Diploma levels provided by CTEVT (Council for TEVT) constituent and affiliated institutions, community colleges and annex programs. Both public and private institutions are eligible for support under this program. The objective of this component is to make access to technical education more equitable, especially to the poor and disadvantaged groups in the lagging regions of Nepal, and to improve the quality and market relevance of the TSLC and Diploma programs. The third component of the project is supporting short-term vocational training and recognition of prior learning. This component supports short term vocational training and the certification of technical and vocational skills acquired through informal means through both public and private institutions. The fourth component of the project is project management and monitoring and evaluation. The responsibility for carrying out the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) activities under the project will be with the Secretariat. Under this sub-component, the Secretariat will establish mechanisms for overall project reporting and to ensure that timely, sufficient, and reasonably complete and accurate information on project inputs, outputs and outcomes are collected, analyzed and disseminated. The project will also provide support to Ministry of Labor and Transport Management/Department of Labor and Transport Management (MOLT/DOLT) for developing a Labor Market Information System (LMIS).",

There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is basic education. The primary objective of this component is to ensure equitable access and quality of basic education for all children in age group 5-12, prepare pre-school-age children through Early Childhood Education and Development (ECED) for basic education and deliver basic numeracy and literacy to youths and adults, especially women and marginalized groups. The second component of the project is secondary education. This component aims to improve equitable access to secondary education by financing: (i) the expansion of physical facilities, including classroom construction and rehabilitation, library and laboratory construction, and the construction of schools for children with special needs (CWSN), and (ii) targeted scholarship schemes for dalits, marginalized groups, disabled, girls and children from poor households. The third component of the project is institutional capacity strengthening. The objective of this component is to improve the capacity of SSRP implementation agencies and its partners to enhance delivery and monitoring of educational services and products.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve living conditions, livelihoods and empowerment among the rural poor, with particular attention to groups that have traditionally been excluded by reasons of gender, ethnicity, caste and location. This is to be achieved through: (a) investing in community selected and managed sub-projects that create access to basic socioeconomic infrastructure and services, increase assets, generate employment and expand income-generating opportunities in poor villages; (b) enhancing the capacity of local bodies, particularly the Village Development Committees (VDCs), to provide better services for poor and socially excluded groups; and (c) improving government efforts to better coordinate support targeted towards poor and excluded groups. Given the rapid and successful implementation under the original PAF project, PAF II will maintain the existing design features, activities and inputs, under the following five components: (a) Small-Scale Village and Community Infrastructure, whereby small investments in infrastructure and services can make an important difference to poor communities; (b) Income Generating Sub-projects by which matching grants will be provided to self-selected groups of poor and excluded people for income-generation activities, based on objective criteria including ethnicity, caste, gender and poverty levels; (c) Innovation and Special Programs to continue to support proposals meriting special consideration owing to exceptional needs in a given context, or demonstrating innovative ways to improve livelihoods development and reach targeted groups; (d) Capacity Building which includes five sub-components: (i) Social Mobilization of Community Groups; (ii) Capacity Building for Local Bodies; (iii) Capacity Building for Target Groups Engaged in Income-Generating Activities; (iv) Support to Rural and Community Finance; (v) Information, Monitoring and Evaluation; and (e) Administration of PAF II which will continue to finance the operating costs of the PAF, including staff costs and other operating expenses.",

Global Partnership on Out-Based Aid (GPOBA) will subsidize the use of biogas plants with a capacity up to 8m3. Subsidies will be paid after a verification report has determined the number of installed plants continuously used by the target population. The verification mechanism is similar to that of the carbon finance component of the project in that it also pays only after receiving proof that biogas plants installed are actually used. As in the carbon finance component of the project this verification will be done on a statistical sample basis. To be eligible for the BSP-IV, households have to meet the following criteria: 1) own at least one bovine, in order to be able to operate the smallest size plant sustainably, 2) own land to build the biogas plant on, and 3) have access to a sufficient amount of water.",

    "description": "The Education for All Project's long-term development objective is to improve access to, and benefit from basic, and primary education for children, especially girls and children from disadvantaged groups, and from literacy programs for poor adults. The project will achieve three strategic goals: a) improving access to, and equity of basic and primary education; b) enhancing educational quality and relevance; and, c) improving efficiency, and institutional capacity of education service delivery. First, equitable access will be approached through measures to increase both the demand for education, and the supply of services. On the demand side, expanded involvement of community-based organizations in identifying, and motivating out of school children to enroll, will strengthen school outreach. Increased literacy for mothers is also expected to have a long-term positive impact. Scholarships, funded through school grants, targeted to poor girls, \"dalits\" and out of school \"janajati\" children, will offset the private costs of schooling for these groups. Additionally, expansion of classrooms, and non-formal programs based in schools, should accommodate growing demand. Resources will also be provided to communities for constructing temporary classrooms. Literacy programs for adult women, targeted to dalits and ethnic minorities, will be expanded. Second, early childhood development (ECD), delivered through community managed centers, and through pre-primary classes, will be expanded, supporting teacher education through a certificate training. Recurrent in-service teacher training will be strengthened, while substantial funding through the School Grants Program (SGP) will enable financing local expertise, including teacher training. Improved school facilities, and newly developed transitional language support on entry for non-Nepali speaking students, will further improve learning quality, retention of children, and school completion rates. And third, improving efficiency and institutional capacity, will finance the transfer of primary schools to community management, through grants support. A feature of the SGP will be the inclusion of funding for non-salary recurrent costs in school grants. Depending on accreditation levels, schools will be eligible to apply for grants for construction improvement, enhanced student access, capacity building, and quality improvement.",

It aims to improve access to income-generation projects and community infrastructure for the groups that have tended to be excluded by reasons of gender, ethnicity and caste, as well as for the poorest groups in rural communities. There are five main project components.  Project Component 1 supports Income generation projects targeted to the poorest and excluded groups. Examples would include micro-irrigation, micro-enterprises, crafts, land productivity, animal husbandry, and others. Project Component 2 supports Small Scale Village and Community Infrastructure: Examples would include engineered trails, footbridges, schools, clinics and other \"public goods\" which are small scale and can be managed by community groups or Village Development Committee (VDCs). Project Component 3 supports innovations and special programs. This component would provide a small amount of finds in a demand-driven window to finance proposals of special merit related to PAF objectives. Project Component 4, a capacity building component, comprises five sub-components: Mobilization of Community Group, with particular attention to the needs of marginalized groups; Capacity Building for local bodies focusing mostly on capacity building to help VDCs; Capacity Building of Target Groups focusing on organizing special training and related activities to enhance the skills of target beneficiaries on their chosen areas of activity; Support to Micro-finance Intermediaries; And a Monitoring and Evaluation System for self-learning. Project Component 5 finances project administration, financing project staff, establishment and operating expenses including financial, procurement and environmental management.",

    "description": "The main objective of the project is to support the on-going efforts to develop a healthier financial sector in Nepal which intermediates funds more efficiently and effectively to the benefit of all segments of society and in a manner which supports private sector development, increased investment, and faster growth. The project has the following four components: Component 1) Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS). The largest component is designed to support the VRS in Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) in an effort to reduce their costs and ultimately assist in making them more saleable/privatizable institutions. Component 2) Hiring of Sales Advisors. The hiring of the Sales (Privatization) Advisors will not happen until a year or so into the project when the banks are in a better financial condition and are therefore more viable privatization candidates. These Advisors will undertake proper due diligence, prepare a prospectus for the banks, and then undertake a road show to bring them to the point of sale to \"fit and proper\" private sector buyers as rapidly as possible. Component 3) Phase II: On-going Nepal Rastra Bank Re-engineering. The Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project has commenced a process of re-engineering within the central bank. However, reform, revitalization, and professionalization are complicated, long-term tasks. Greatly enhancing the capacity of NRB to oversee a prudently operated banking system is a prime objective of the series of reforms being undertaken within the sector. Whereas the Phase I reforms in banking supervision have focused on developing an appropriate off-site reporting system and a minimalist amount of on-site bank supervisory assistance, the Phase I1 reforms will assist in augmenting the on-site supervisory capacities to oversee the commercial banks. Component 4) Management Team Support. It is agreed, that the two banks may not be privatized by the time that the current three year term of the existing Management Teams expire (two years with a possible one-year extension). It is equally recognized that the banks should not revert to old management practices. It is therefore necessary to include funding for a contingency to cover the costs of continuing management team support up until the point of privatization.",

    "description": "Within the context of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), this First Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) Project will support economic growth generation, service delivery improvements, social inclusion promotion, and governance improvements. The PRSC program supports selective key reforms that will directly contribute to pro-poor growth by a) creating fiscal space for, and improving the effectiveness of growth enhancing public investments, and, b) improving the investment climate. The PRSC program also supports Nepal's track record of meaningful reforms in improving service delivery by assisting the government in developing annual benchmarks, consistent with the broad reform objectives, and, by providing the fiscal and technical resources necessary to accelerate the reform momentum. The PRSC process supports the promotion of social inclusion, by improving the effectiveness of targeted programs; improving access to schooling for excluded groups, and, by encouraging civil service diversity. It also supports the government's strategy to improve governance by improving the effectiveness of the civil service, strengthening anti-corruption and accountability institutions, improving the functioning of key agencies, and, improving financial management and procurement practices. The improvements in governance that are supported by the PRSC are designed to bring more accountable, efficient, and a less corrupt government, that will create a more favorable investment climate, and lead to better service delivery. Nonetheless, risks include the potential return to a prolonged period of conflict, that would dampen growth prospects, and the impact of structural reforms on poverty, while the efforts of reform-minded technocrats, may be crowded  by political interference, thus threaten the sustainability of reforms, and in addition, a further worsening of global economic conditions may undermine the impact of growth-enhancing reforms. However, many of the reforms outlined have a wide degree of support across the political spectrum, and from civil society, as they have been based on consensus-building exercises and stakeholder consultations, and, the Bank will provide a loan acceleration clause that would allow the Bank to demand immediate repayment of the proposed loan by the Borrower, in case reforms are reversed, or materially changed.",

At the district level, the component will provide training to district education staff for basic district planning; and at the community level, the component will provide training to headteachers in school improvement planning. 2) Raising learning achievement will improve teaching and learning process by reviewing the curriculum content of grades 1 to 3, carry out action research with teachers in small, multigrade schools, and increase textbook availability through the introduction of a voucher system. It will also expand teacher professional support systems and improve teacher quality through demand driven training. 3) Increasing equitable access and improving retention will develop funding mechanism to utilize nongovernmental organizations and community-based organizations to deliver early childhood development programs and provide incentives targeted at the most disadvantaged families through supplying free textbooks and scholarships to needy girls.",

The project consists of two components: agricultural research and extension service. The first component will: 1) strengthen the agricultural research institutions by improving the management information system, priority setting of research programs, and monitoring implementation and evaluating impact; 2) support human resource development by training research scientists, and introduce a results-oriented and performance-based reward system; 3) expand on-farm adaptive research responsive to farmers needs; and 4) provide facilities, infrastructure, and working capital for research institutions. The second component will: 1) strengthen the extension service by decentralizing to the grass roots level and strengthening farmer self-help groups; 2) develop human capital by training extension staff, and implement a reward system based on results and performance; and 3) provide facilities, infrastructure, and working capital for individual participants.",

The project to be implemented over a seven-year period includes:  (i) improvements to the Chatra Main Canal including provisions for improved desilting; (ii) the rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation distribution and drainage works on 16,700 ha; (iii) further minor improvements to the irrigation and drainage system in the Stage I area (9,750 ha), and (iv) the construction of buildings for offices, and staff quarters.  It further involves (v) the provision of equipment and vehicles for O&M, and equipment for the project workshop; (vi) institutional strengthening through technical assistance, training, and studies; and (vii) financial support for the costs of incremental project establishment and maintenance.  One of the important irrigation management improvements will be the extension of the distribution system to reach 4-5 ha blocks.  This feature is expected to:  (i) enable farmers to construct channels to individual fields; (ii) simplify the allocation of water, and (iii) lead to more effective water users' groups.",

The project also includes provision of fertilizer for the project area. It is expected that the project will reach nearly 50% of the 147,000 farm families in the project area. Irrigation works benefitting at least 10,000 farm families and trails and bridges benefitting all the population in these districts will also be upgraded. In view of the remoteness of the project area, there is a risk that all components may not be undertaken effectively and the interrelated services may not be provided; there is also the risk that area farmers may not have access to the development services. The project is therefore designed to minimize the administrative and logistical difficulties of providing services in remote areas through the use of local agricultural service centers. These centers have been found to be effective in other projects in marshalling and directing services and in reaching a broad spectrum of participants.",

    "description": "The proposed project would be the first phase of a twenty year national forestry program aiming to develop community forestry in the Hills and to establish training facilities in Nepal to satisfy needs for qualified forestry, soil and water conservation personnel. The proposed project would increase supplies of fuelwood in Hill areas through establishment of new plantations and rehabilitation of degraded forests. The Ministry of Forest would be reorganized and strengthened through the provision of supporting services and training facilities. Technical assistance would be provided to assist in execution of field planting programs, in organization and administration of the new Community Forestry and Afforestation Division, and in establishment of the training and research programs. Production from project plantings would reach a peak in year 20 of the project when timber from the Panchayat Forests is clear-felled; total production in that year would provide about one-third of the total fuelwood requirements of the 1.9 million people in the 340 panchayats participating in the project. The annual sustainable yield of fuelwood from Panchayat Protected Forests and private plantings would be sufficient to provide the full requirements of 10 percent of the project area population.",

The UAHEP is a peaking run-of-river plant with installed capacity of 1,040 MW and diurnal storage of 6 hours. A 23 km long access road will be constructed to connect the power plant to the Koshi Highway. A 5.8 km long 400 kV double circuit transmission line will be constructed to evacuate power to Nepal’s grid. The Project will also support advancing the regional dialogue in South Asia, support disaster risk management on the Arun River, and enhance the resilience of the Koshi Province power system. The Government of Nepal has prioritized the development of this Project to augment power generation in the integrated Nepal power system, due to its relatively low cost of generation and availability of abundant firm energy. The Project also includes a community support program and an indigenous people’s plan.",

The grant will provide basic skills and organization to create the ecosystem for business in the rural economy. Multiple innovative women’s economic empowerment models will be pilot-tested through value chain development (e.g. spices and natural fiber crafts, etc.). This will be implemented through the formation of producer groups that will be provided with skill upgrading, marketing, prototype development, basic financial literacy and accounting. The project will support the establishment/strengthening of community facilitation centers (CFCs) at community level, which will train community professionals to manage the CFCs and support producer groups beyond pilot implementation. It will also support capable group members demonstrating business growth, consistently increased profitability and product diversification based on market demands to further improve their individual businesses.",

For the Restructuring stage, the focus is on strengthening gaps in health systems and education services that affect early childhood development services, i.e. supporting minor upgrades of ECD centers, health facilities, systems for planning and budgeting.  For the Resilient recovery stage, the focus is on data systems for health, education and social protection that would ensure informed policy decisions are made and systems in The project will achieve its objectives by first supporting implementation of the government’s national strategies in a complex institutional environment that requires continued high level engagement and commitment and high level leverage over sectoral programs, then promoting and stimulating investments at the Local Levels, which are the may agent on implementation of policies. The project will support parts of the broader human capital development agenda by focusing on selected activities to improve utilization of basic services by population, mainly the poor and vulnerable to as per the mandate of the Local Levels. It will follow a life cycle approach focusing on early years and adolescence, which are two key moments in life to intervene.  Hence, it will help GoN to achieve its goals by (i) providing a clear operational framework; (ii) helping to fix management problems that constrain effective delivery of programs and interventions; (iii) maintaining focus on a core package of priority services critical to early years development and adolescent girls; (iv) providing incentives for multi-sectoral and multi-level coordination; (v) helping generate data across the results chain and levels of government, including outputs and intermediate outcomes at the three government levels. Therefore, Local Level Government will have the knowledge, tools and financing to ensure implementation of existent programs and policies through an effective delivery system centered around the people.  To enhance people centric services, digital tools including media and outreach activities to communities and households will be made to reach the unreached. In the end, the project will address significant levels of malnutrition (which also contributes to learning poverty), geographical disparities, social exclusion, and gender inequality, promoting an effective delivery system and harnessing digital technology to improve Local Level service delivery  and to create more resilient sector in presence of shocks. As such the project supports the World Bank agenda and the Nepal 3R agenda (Relief, Restructuring, Resilient Recovery) as it is aligned with CPF objectives and GoN agenda. For the Relief stage, the design addresses gaps in the immediate impacts of the pandemic, especially by supporting the demand side of utilizing health and education services through mobilization of communities.  For the Restructuring stage, the focus is on strengthening gaps in health systems and education services that affect early childhood development services, i.e. supporting minor upgrades of ECD centers, health facilities, systems for planning and budgeting.  For the Resilient recovery stage, the focus is on data systems for health, education and social protection that would ensure informed policy decisions are made and systems in place under federalism which can respond to shocks and continue to deliver essential services.",
